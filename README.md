# STEP-i-Internship-Tasks

1. As a data analysis intern, I completed the following operations on the provided general store transaction dataset using MS Excel

* Created a Pivot table to get the different types of outlets and their counts
* Created a Pivot table to get the total sales for different outlets
* Created a Pivot table to find out the total sales of different item types in different outlet types
* In the third Pivot table, filtered out (remove) low-fat products 
* Added slicers for item fat and item type in the last Pivot table

2. Also, I tried to prepare a basic Dashboard on MS Excel for Profit and Loss statement of a company for the year 2020.

3. I analyzed sports data for the given two datasets related to IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches by importing the datasets into an SQL database and perform the tasks given in this assignment to find important insights from this dataset. One dataset contains ball-by-ball data and the other contains match-wise data between the years 2008-2020.

Wrote queries in SQL for the following tasks:

* Created a table named ‘matches’ with appropriate data types for columns
* Created a table named ‘deliveries’ with appropriate data types for columns
* Imported the data from CSV file ’IPL_matches.csv’ attached in resources to ‘matches’
* Imported the data from CSV file ’IPL_Ball.csv’ attached in resources to ‘deliveries’
* Select the top 20 rows of the deliveries table.
* Select the top 20 rows of the matches table.
* Fetched data of all the matches played on 2nd May 2013.
* Fetched data of all the matches where the margin of victory is more than 100 runs.
* Fetched data of all the matches where the final scores of both teams tied and ordered it in descending order of the date.
* As an output to the the  SQL query, got the count of cities that have hosted an IPL match.
